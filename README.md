# Cybersecurity-Portfolio
I am a passionate and curious driven cybersecurity enthusiast with a strong foundation in time management, having the ability to always learn and be curious. I want to improve in the fields of assessing vulnerabilities, incident response, risk management, security policies and threat intelligence. I am currently committed to working towards certifications such as the CompTIA Security+ and the Google Cybersecurity certificate. My learning continues with labs on TryHackMe and Linux on pwn.college. I am part of a club on my campus called the Computer Security Group. 

My goals include wanting to protect organizations from security breaches and empower people to be safer online. I am fascinated by the evolving nature of cybersecurity and playing an important role in defending and combating cyber risks. My aim is to connect with cybersecurity recruiters and I want to showcase my understanding of tools such as WireShark, Splunk, Linux, Python and important frameworks such as NIST and ISO.  

I value ongoing learning throughout my lifetime, working with teams on issues to implement security policies, and educating people on security threats. Ultimately, I aim to build strong security postures for organizations and have strong dedication to help businesses protect their data and sensitive information while improving the overall system.
